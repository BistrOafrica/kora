// Package contract — capability handle contract (PLUGIN-001).
//
// Components never construct providers directly; they request capabilities and
// receive handles. The issuer grants only what the component's manifest
// declared (deny-by-default), scoped to component, operation, or call. A handle
// carries an owner, a scope, and cleanup evidence so every effect is
// attributable and releasable (invariant 6/7).
